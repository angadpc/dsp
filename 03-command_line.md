# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > 
1. pwd - shows current working directory path 
2. mkdir - create a directory 
3. rmdir - delete a directory 
4. touch file_name(s) - creates a file 
5. rm file_name(s) - deletes file, rm -rf file_name(s) - recursively deletes all files/folders which are in a tree structure
6. mv original_file new_file - renames a file 
7. ls -a - lists all hidden files 
8. cp dir1/file dir2
9. piping = ex: cat filename|less - this takes the output of cat filename, and combines it with the command less. piping essentially group commands together to execute them from one output to another 
10. grep - scan the document and present the user with the desired result. Sort of like the ctrl+F shortcut on a Mac.
